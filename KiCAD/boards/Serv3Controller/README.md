# Serv3Controller
This is a controller board for three servo motors. In addition to the standard components, it contains:
- three IRLML6344TRPBF N-channel MOSFETs for switching servo power
- STATUS LEDs for each servo to indicate both power and fault conditions
- two 2-terminal 2.54mm pitch screw terminals for servo voltage (5V or greater)
- 33mohm current sense resistors on each servo to detect stall conditions
- three standard 2.54mm male pin headers to connect to servos
The board itself is 42.4mm x 29.6mm and uses M2 mounting holes.
